# DCArray
A MFC CArray version that does sucks. With a few extra feature like: Find, Push, Pop, 
in Clearcode tm.

2 MB exe simply by using CString CArray. NO way. 
So, I have rewritten the whole thing in what I call ClearCode. 
It's a strick style of writing code and method.
I have invented it in the 90's

I went from 2MB to 16K. Still big for a 32bit but acceptable.

# Note for linux Programmer: ... 
  ....Comming soon 
  You should use the Linux compatible version: DCLinuxString.h
  I haven't tested it please make sure you run the test. 
  *If it's not too much trouble let me know how it went. 
  
# How to use:
  Just add the DCArray.h/DCLinuxArray.h to your project.
